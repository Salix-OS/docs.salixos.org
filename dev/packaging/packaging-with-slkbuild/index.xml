    <title>Building Packages with slkbuild :: Salix Documentation</title>
    <link>/dev/packaging/packaging-with-slkbuild/</link>
    <description>slkbuild is a script which makes package creation much easier. It parses a meta file called a SLKBUILD and creates a conventional build-name.sh script and then optionally runs it. It is inspired by the arch build system and greatly simplifies the build process. It is available in the repositories and it is a good idea to have it installed when going through this tutorial. Note that this is not a substitute for knowing how to compile.</description>
