    <description>What you should do before submitting packages You should register in the Salix-main mailing list. All development discussions are taking place there.&#xA;What packages to submit Feel free to submit packages for any open source software you like. Replacing Slackware packages is generally not accepted, unless there is a really important reason.&#xA;You can also package proprietary software, provided re-distribution of that software is allowed (like for example the opera web browser).</description>
