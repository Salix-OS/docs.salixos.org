    <title>UIDs and GIDs to use with slkbuild :: Salix Documentation</title>
    <link>/dev/packaging/uid-gid/</link>
    <description>Recommended UID/GIDs The recommended UID/GIDs for use with SLKBUILD scripts are the same as the ones for slackbuilds.org (Default Slackware UID/GIDs) in order to avoid conflicts with packages build from SBo.&#xA;Extra This previous list is maintained by the SBo team. If you build a package that is not on that list, we can discuss about it on the mailing list.&#xA;Warning Note that recommended UID/GIDs should not be created automatically when the user installs a package.</description>
