Upgrading to a new Salix release is a straightforward process, and we've put
together a series of tutorials to guide you through it. Below, you'll find
step-by-step instructions on how to upgrade from one Salix release to the next.
Please note that only upgrading to the next consecutive release is officially
supported, so it's recommended to upgrade in sequence rather than skipping
releases. Attempting to upgrade multiple releases at once is not recommended
and may lead to unexpected issues.
