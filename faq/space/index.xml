    <link>/faq/space/</link>
    <description>For the three different installation modes available, Salix occupies approximately the following amounts of disk space respectively:&#xA;FULL: 2.4GB BASIC: 1.4GB CORE: 840MB So, depending on which installation mode you choose, you need to have a partition with at least that much space available.&#xA;These sizes are the absolute minimum that youâ€™ll require. You have to account for any extra software you might want to install and of course for all your files.</description>
