For the three different installation modes available, Salix occupies
approximately the following amounts of disk space respectively:

* *FULL:* 2.4GB
* *BASIC:* 1.4GB
* *CORE:* 840MB

So, depending on which installation mode you choose, you need to have a
partition with at least that much space available.

These sizes are the *absolute minimum* that you'll require. You have to
account for any extra software you might want to install and of course
for all your files.

You should have at least some space available for temporary files (in
`/tmp`) and package downloads (in `/var/slapt-get`). If you want to
install extra software you need to make room for those too. You should
also consider how much space you want to have available in your `/home`.
