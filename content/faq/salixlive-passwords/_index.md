title: "SalixLive Passwords"
---

You can log in SalixLive as user
**one**. The password is also **one**. User **one** can use the
*sudo* command to execute commands as the superuser.

The root user is disabled by default and therefore you can't log in as root.

## Salix 14.0 and earlier

These are now old and unsupported releases of Salix, but just in case you
happen to come across one, here is the relevant information:

- You log in as user **one**. If you need to make any changes to the system, you need to become **root**.
- The Salix Live non-root username is **one** with no password.
- The Salix Live root password is **live**.
