For Salix 14.1 and newer there is no root user. You can log in as user
**one** and the password is also **one**. User **one** can use the
*sudo* command to execute commands as the superuser.

For Salix 14.0 and earlier:
- The Salix Live root password is **live**.
- The Salix Live non-root username is **one** with no password.
