**Welcome to the Salix Documentation project!** This is the place for
tutorials, guides and frequently asked questions for both Salix users
and developers.

You can navigate the documentation through the menubar, or search for a
term using the sidebar.

Documentation is generally split into three sections:

* [Frequently Asked Questions](/faq)
* [User Documentation](/user)
* [Developer Documentation](/dev)

You can navigate the documentation or use the search bar for looking up
specific terms. Note that the search function requires Javascript.

If you can't find what you're looking for, or have a suggestion for new
content, please don't hesitate to reach out in our
[forums](https://forum.salixos.org/),
[IRC channel](https://salixos.org/chat.html) or the
[mailing list](https://salixos.org/mailinglists.html).

If you would like to edit existing documentation or add new articles, you can
do it by forking the
[git repository](https://github.com/Salix-OS/docs.salixos.org)
at Github and making
a pull request. We're constantly updating and improving the documentation, and
your feedback is invaluable in helping us make it more comprehensive and
user-friendly. Happy reading!
