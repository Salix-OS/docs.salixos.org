# Salix Documentation

**Welcome to the Salix Documentation project!** This is the place for
tutorials, guides and frequently asked questions for both Salix users
and developers.

You can navigate the documentation through the menubar, or search for a
term using the sidebar.

Documentation is generally split into three sections:

* [Frequently Asked Questions](/faq)
* [User Documentation](/user)
* [Developer Documentation](/dev)
