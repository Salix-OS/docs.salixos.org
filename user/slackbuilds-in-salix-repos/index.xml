    <title>Slackbuilds in Salix Repositories :: Salix Documentation</title>
    <link>/user/slackbuilds-in-salix-repos/</link>
    <description>Salix integrates dependency management for packages in its own repositories and those built from slackbuilds.org, whose package list is mirrored by Salix, using slapt-src.&#xA;Where a package is available from both sources, the Salix package is always preferred, even if it is a less recent version. Should you wish to replace it with a build from source, you will need to do so manually from the slackbuilds.org website, and exclude the package in /etc/slapt-getrc to prevent it being automatically downgraded when you do a general package upgrade.</description>
