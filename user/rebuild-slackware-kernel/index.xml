    <title>How to Rebuild the Slackware Kernel :: Salix Documentation</title>
    <link>/user/rebuild-slackware-kernel/</link>
    <description>It should be noted that the default kernel that ships with Salix will work in the vast majority of cases, and no recompiling is necessary. You should only recompile if:&#xA;Your systemâ€™s hardware (or other feature) is not supported by the default kernel You believe the same kernel can be built with an option to support it To get an extra fraction of a percent hardware performance For fun Before going ahead, it may be easier (and will in many cases be sufficient to solve the problem) to install the kernel from slackware current, which will always be relatively recent.</description>
