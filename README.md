This repository includes the contents of the Salix Documentation, hosted at
[docs.salixos.org](https://docs.salixos.org/). It is written in
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the
[Hugo Relearn Theme](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn).

Please use Hugo version 0.123.8 for building this project. Newer versions may
not work correctly with the current version of the theme.

Category index pages are created automatically when running `make`. Category
header text is in the `headers` directory and footer text is in the `footers`
directory.
